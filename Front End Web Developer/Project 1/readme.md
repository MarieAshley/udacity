# Instructions
You will be provided with a design mockup as a PDF-file and must replicate that design in HTML and CSS. You will develop a responsive website that will display images, descriptions, and links to each of the portfolio projects you will complete throughout the course of your Nanodegree program.

The design mockup is located [here](https://d17h27t6h515a5.cloudfront.net/topher/2017/November/5a136147_design-mockup-portfolio/design-mockup-portfolio.pdf).
